# A Modula-2 Library implemented on TopSpeed-Modula-2 to manage db3, clarion, dos, zip and others file types.

## FM is low level library.

### * db_cla implement a CLASS to manage Clarion (*.dat) files.
### * db_db3 implement a CLASS to manage dBase3 (*.dbf) files.
### * db_btrv implement a CLASS to manage Btrieve (*.dat) files.
### * db_dos implement a CLASS to manage DOS raw (Binary Files) files.
### * db_lzg implement a CLASS to manage Compress Binary Files (multiple compress algorithms supported, ZIP, Huffman versiones, etc).

The purpose of this post is to provide examples of use and clear, self-explanatory code in Modula-2.

Modula-2 is a reference language and its algorithms are clear. From this code you can get ideas and structures that are useful for other languages ​​and projects.

I hope you find it useful and if you find it useful I would like to know.

## Thank you very much Gustavo.S
