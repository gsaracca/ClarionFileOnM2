# A Modula-2 Library implemented on TopSpeed-Modula-2 then Clarion-M2, then SV-M2 to manage db3, clarion, dos, zip and others file types.

## This library is OOP 

FM is low level library.

The purpose of this post is to provide examples of use and clear, self-explanatory code in Modula-2.

Modula-2 is a reference language and its algorithms are clear. From this code you can get ideas and structures that are useful for other languages ​​and projects.

I hope you find it useful and if you find it useful I would like to know.

## Thank you very much Gustavo.S
